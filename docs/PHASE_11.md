### Phase 11: Social Justice & Accessibility
**Making Law Accessible**

#### Step 32: Efficiency Gains → Lower Costs
**Priority**: Medium | **Effort**: Medium | **Mission**: Critical

**What**: Use AI efficiency gains to make legal services more accessible.

**Vision**:
> "If AI would only make law more efficient, I would find this a bit of a depressing future. But perhaps AI can help make law more accessible to people who cannot currently afford it. Using AI to contribute to social justice - now that's an AI-powered future I can believe in."

**Implementation**:
- **Tiered Service Model**:
  - Premium: Full-service legal representation
  - Standard: AI-assisted legal services (lower cost)
  - Pro Bono: AI-powered self-help for those who can't afford lawyers

- **AI-Assisted Pro Bono Work**:
  - Use AI to handle more pro bono cases
  - Efficiency gains allow helping more people
  - Simple cases can be handled faster with AI assistance
  - Complex cases get more lawyer time

- **Self-Service Legal Tools** (future):
  - AI-guided document preparation
  - Legal information chatbot
  - Template generation for common needs
  - Educational resources
  - Triaged referrals to human lawyers when needed

**Measuring Impact**:
- Track pro bono hours enabled by AI efficiency
- Number of people helped who couldn't afford traditional rates
- Cost reduction for standard legal services
- Access to justice metrics

**Philosophical Foundation**:
The goal is not to replace lawyers or just make law firms more profitable. The goal is to use technology to expand access to justice for those who need it most.

**Success Criteria**:
- 30%+ increase in pro bono capacity
- 20%+ reduction in costs for standard services
- Measurable increase in access to justice
- Maintain quality of legal services
- Positive social impact documented
