### Phase 8: Small Tasks with Mandatory Validation
**Reliable AI Through Human Oversight**

#### Step 27: Validated Automation
**Priority**: High | **Effort**: Medium

**What**: Automate small tasks but always require human validation.

**Proven Workflows** (from the lawyer's practice):

1. **Automatic Email Filing**:
   - AI reads incoming email
   - Determines which matter it belongs to
   - Suggests filing location
   - User confirms or corrects
   - Creates time entry draft
   - Success Rate: ~85% correct classification

2. **Email Summarization**:
   - AI summarizes email in 2-3 sentences
   - Highlights action items
   - User reviews before saving
   - Summary added to matter file

3. **Task Extraction**:
   - AI reads meeting notes or emails
   - Extracts action items and deadlines
   - Proposes tasks with due dates
   - User reviews and adds to task list

4. **Time Entry Generation**:
   - AI monitors work activities
   - Drafts time entries with descriptions
   - Suggests appropriate time allocations
   - User reviews and approves before saving

5. **Document Summarization**:
   - AI summarizes long documents
   - Extracts key clauses and terms
   - User reviews for accuracy
   - Summary saved to matter file

**Validation Workflow**:
```
AI Processing → Draft Output → User Review → User Edits/Approves → Save
                                     ↓
                              [Always Required]
```

**Success Criteria**:
- Zero automatic saves without review
- 80%+ suggestions accepted with minor edits
- Time savings: 30-50% on administrative tasks
- User maintains full control
- Easy to correct AI errors

#### Step 28: Workflows NOT Automated
**Priority**: N/A | **Philosophy**

**What**: Explicit list of tasks to keep human-led.

**Never Automate**:
1. **Drafting Client Communications**
   - Emails to clients
   - Legal letters
   - Settlement proposals
   - Reason: Personal touch is essential to client relationships

2. **Legal Analysis & Advice**
   - Legal opinions
   - Risk assessments
   - Strategy decisions
   - Reason: Professional judgment required

3. **Court Filings**
   - Complaints
   - Motions
   - Briefs
   - Reason: Professional responsibility and liability

4. **Final Document Approval**
   - Contracts before signature
   - Legal documents before filing
   - Reason: Professional duty of care

**Philosophy**:
> "The fun part is helping other people, and I don't want an AI to come between that."

AI should handle the tasks lawyers don't enjoy (administrative work, document processing, research grunt work) so lawyers can focus on the meaningful parts: client relationships and strategic thinking.
